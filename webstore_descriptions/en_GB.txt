When you search something on google it can query ChatGPT for you automatically and show the chat results alongside google's results right on google's page. It suggests follow-up questions and also allows you to continue the chat with ChatGPT without having to leave google's home page. Unlike few other tools here there is no limit on the number of free queries per day. You have access to unlimited free queries.
